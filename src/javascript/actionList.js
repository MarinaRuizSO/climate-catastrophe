    information: 'Reducing sulphate emissions is a difficult task, so some extreme measures need to be taken. Fossil fuels constitute around 70% of the energy sources, so divesting from these companies will be a big step forward to having a healthier environment and reducing the natural hazards related to high sulphate emissions. Areas with high concentration of coal burning factories and energy production have poorer air quality and are susceptible to having acid rain. Due to wind motions, the emissions can be transported across the country and have disastrous effects. ',

A lot of farmers are burning the waste products, increasing the sulphate emissions and wasting organic products that can be reused. By creating recycling plants where farmers can bring their waste to and obtain biproducts of the waste in return can help tackle this problem.

The coastal areas are increasingly having air quality issues and the emissions are also getting transported to surrounding areas. The increase in demand of products from China is increasing the use of ships, so there is a need for stricter controls of fuels. However, this not being enough, you decide to start investing in researching how solar or wind energy could be used to power ships. A bold move? It will for sure be better than investing in the fossil fuel companies that provide carburant now. ',
