    information: 'Quick! There’s a volcanic eruption on its way! You need to put in place evacuation procedures and offer food and accommodation to those who have had to leave their homes. If it wasn’t enough, volcanoes are the main source of natural sulphate aerosols, which means that sulphate content in the region is going to largely increase, causing all kinds of havoc such as heavy acid rains, brown hazes and contributing to the changes in the monsoon patterns already created by man-made aerosols.

    information: 'It looks like the droughts in the North are causing a lot of forest fires, which are emitting a lot of sulphates in the atmosphere...You need to act quickly as send special fire brigades to the North and also supply people with survival kits and shelter for those who have lost their houses. You also need to enforce more policies to reduce sulphate emission, you are running out of time, and natural disasters keep on increasing!',

    heading: 'Acid Rain',
    information: 'Despite all your efforts to reduce sulphate emissions, there have recently been a lot of episodes of acid rain, which is caused when the sulphate (and nitrate) in the atmosphere reacts with water and makes it “acid”. This type of rain is a hazard for ecosystems, as it kills trees and vegetation and limits the animal species that can live in an acidic environment. In cities, it damages buildings and has negative health effects on the population. If you want to save your country from a climate catastrophe, you are going to have to try harder to reduce sulphate emissions.',
