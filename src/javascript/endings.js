    information: 'Congratulations, you have managed to to lead your country to a\
     healthier environment! It was not an easy road, but your persistence and \
     caring for the planet have paid off. Your country has now low sulphate emissions,\
      in line with international treaties, and is on the way to reduce them even more.\
       You have successfully implemented renewable energy sources and closed off polluting\
        factories in favor of cleaner production modes. Cities can breathe again and the acid \
        rain episodes are now very sparse. With no more sulphate-induced dimming of \
        the atmosphere, everyone can now see the Sun,  and the monsoon circulation has gone\
         back to the way it was before: this is great news for everyone as the human and economic\
          costs from monsoon-related extreme events was very high. ',

    information: 'Today is a sad day for your countryâ€¦sulphate emissions \
    have not seen a decrease under your mandate and they continue to be a \
    health and environment hazard. The floods from the Southern regions and\
     the droughts in the North are persistent in the summer monsoon months, \
     and the number of deaths from these extreme events continue to increase.\
      The monsoon circulation and winds are still offset by sulphate aerosols\
       decreasing the solar radiation reaching the surface and the acid rain \
       and brown haze events continue in highly polluted areas, giving residents\
        respiratory problems and heavily damaging ecosystem. Luckily, this is \
        not real life and the planet is giving you a second chance to make things\
         better for everyone. Try again and prove everyone that you are a responsible'
