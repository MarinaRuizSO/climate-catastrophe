    heading: 'Welcome to Climate Catastrophe!',
    information: 'In this game, you are an environmental policy maker in China,\
     and you have been given the mission to decrease sulphate emissions. \
     These types of emissions are changing the summer monsoon pattern and \
     increasing the frequency of the extreme climate events, putting millions of lives at risk. \
In each turn, you will be able to select multiple actions from the left hand side panel, \
using the different attributes you have been given. These quantities are: money, popularity, sulphates\
 and political power (left to right order from the score at the bottom panel). \
Each action will have certain costs and benefits which will affect your final performance \
on reducing sulphate emissions. You can take as many or as few actions as you want during \
each turn, as long as you have enough political power. You can click on the action for an explanation \
of what it involves and to implement it.\
 Once you are done, you can just click\
 on “End Turn” to continue to the next turn. Certain events will happen randomly throughout \
 the game and affect your score, some of these will depend on your performance but you \
 can’t stop them. \
The game ends when you run out of money or your popularity is too low.\
 If you manage to make it to the end, there will be different outcomes depending on how \
 well you have done your job! \
GOOD LUCK AND LET’S AVOID THE NEXT CLIMATE CATASTROPHE!',
